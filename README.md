# Travel Agency Page

This is my third project from the freeCodeCamp Certified Full Stack Developer (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) curriculum, completed as part of my journey to become a front-end/full-stack developer.

## Overview
A webpage for Expedição Brasil, showcasing travel itineraries in Brazil (Chapada Diamantina, Fernando de Noronha, Pantanal).

## Features
- **HTML**: Semantic structure with `<header>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, and `<footer>`.
- **CSS**: External stylesheet (`style.css`) with colors (`background-color`), `margin`, and responsive images.
- **SEO**: Added `<meta name="description">` and Open Graph Tags for social sharing, as explained in the HTML Fundamentals lesson.

## What I Learned
- Improving SEO with meta tags (description, Open Graph).
- Styling with an external CSS file for a clean design.

## Next Steps
- Explore media elements and build a Video Compilation Page.
- Deepen CSS knowledge with layouts.

## Setup
To view locally:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rodolfoespinola/travel-agency-page.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser or use a Live Server.
